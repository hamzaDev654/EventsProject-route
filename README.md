# EventsProject-route

This Event management sytem project is able to Create, Update, Delete, Read (CRUD) events by using  react-router-dom functions and Hooks . 
Its coverd all functionaility reagrading router which should be in such apps or  make the navigation with realtive path. 
Apart from having the parenet root to child root router which is responible to exchanging the data between redering events as per the requests on
the components accordingly . 
To avoiding router hooks clashing eachother due to passing router Objets keys such as (actions, loader) therein added 
extra hooks which usefetcher (which allow to submit the rquest without transitioning the navigations) .
 
PS: Do not foget to read (how-to-use.text) file .
 
Thank you !
